"Pausa Caff√®" is an open-source social network platform written in pure HTML, CSS, JS, PHP with a MySQL database. This project was developed as part of the 'Web Development' exam during my Bachelor's degree. The goal was to demonstrate the basic architecture of a PHP-based web application. Please note that all the code and comments on git are in Italian.
