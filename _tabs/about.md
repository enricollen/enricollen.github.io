Hello there! I'm Enrico Nello, a Computer Engineer with MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data Engineering. I've had a passion for computing since my youth, which has shaped my academic paths until now. When I'm not geeking out 💻, I'm really into wildlife photography (check out some of my shots [here](https://www.juzaphoto.com/me.php?l=it&p=224911))📸 and surfing 🏄‍♂️, hobbies that refresh my mind and enhance my creativity.
