Hello there! I'm Enrico Nello, a Computer Engineer currently enrolled in MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Engineering at the University of Pisa. I've had a passion for computing since my youth, which has shaped my academic paths until now. When I'm not geeking out 💻, I enjoy practicing wildlife photography 📸 and surfing 🏄‍♂️, hobbies that refresh my mind and enhance my creativity.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/enricollen) for more detailed insights into my coding activities and repositories.
